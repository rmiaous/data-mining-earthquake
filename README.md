From the above chart, diagram and map, analysis diplays earthquakes, which are over 5, magitude almost happened at every months.

With raising magnitude of earquakes, the number of earquakes become decreasing.

With raising magnitude of earquakes, the depth of earquakes is increasing. However, the highest magitude of earquakes have small size depth.

There is no corrolation relationship between magintude and depth of earthquakes.

The over 5.5 magitude Earthquakes mostly occured plate boundaries, especially on the Pacific plate boundaies. Global warming is a reason for increased earthquake activities. Rising sea levels may change the balance of pressure on Earth's plates, thus causing an increase in the frequency and intensity of earthquakes.
